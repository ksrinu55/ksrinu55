💫 About Me:
👋 Hi, I’m Korra Srinu

I’m a Senior Undergraduate in Computer Science & Engineering at IIT Kanpur, focused on Data Analytics, Business Intelligence, and Data-Driven Problem Solving.

With experience working on 1M+ real-world transactional records, I specialize in turning raw data into clean insights, interactive dashboards, and scalable analytics workflows.
My CSE background gives me strong foundations in algorithms, databases, operating systems, and web technologies, enabling me to build end-to-end analytical solutions, not just visualizations.

🚀 What I Bring as a Data Analyst

What I Bring to the Team
I have hands-on experience working with large datasets, writing efficient SQL, building dashboards, and automating reporting workflows. My CSE background helps me understand how data systems work at a deeper level, and I focus on delivering insights that are accurate and genuinely useful. I learn quickly, adapt well to new environments, and can handle pressure when needed. I communicate openly, work well with teams, and consistently put in the effort to improve both my skills and the quality of my work.

Foundations of ML, including feature engineering and domain adaptation
My engineering background helps me understand data from both a technical and business impact perspective.
